## What do the version numbers mean? ##

xBehave.net uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). The current release is 0.x which means 'initial development'. Breaking changes are being kept to a minimum, since the library is already being piloted by a number of projects, so you are encouraged to start using xBehave.net right away. Certain parts of the API may be deprecated during initial development but, wherever practical, will not be removed before version 1.0 is released.
