How to build Xbehave.net
========================

*NOTE* These instructions are *only* for building with Rake - if you just want to build Xbehave.net manually you can do so just by loading the solution into Visual Studio and pressing build :-)

Prerequisites
-------------

1. Download and install Ruby 1.8.7+ from http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads
2. At the command prompt run the following to update RubyGems to the latest version: 

	gem update --system

3. You will need the albacore gem, install this at the command prompt with:

	gem install albacore

If you have already installed albacore, please update to the lastest version (0.2.6+):

	gem update albacore

4. In order to build using Mono, install Mono 2.10.9 or higher. Earlier versions may also work if Microsoft.Build.dll is manually added to the Mono GAC.

Building Xbehave.net
--------------------

1. At the command prompt, navigate to the Xbehave.net root folder (should contain rakefile.rb)
2. To run the default build (which will compile, test and package Xbehave.net) type the following command:

	rake

In addition, you can see the full list of all the build tasks by running:

	rake -T

To run a particular task ('spec' for example), use the following command:

	rake spec

You can run multiple tasks by listing them ('spec' then 'nugetpack' for example):

	rake spec nugetpack

You can force the use of Mono in Windows by setting the 'mono' variable to a non-empty value.

    rake mono=x
    rake mono=x spec
    rake mono=x spec nugetpack
    
After the build has completed, there will be a new folder called "bin" containing the build artifacts.
